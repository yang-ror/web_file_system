### Web File System
This project intent to provide a "local explorer" style file system on the web. This gives users nearly the same experience of browsing local files on the web browser, including drag and drop files, rename, copy, cut-and-paste, etc.

The frontend is implemented with javascript and JQuery \ JQuery UI, and it's nearly completed. The offical backend is not yet implemented, still deciding between Java Sprint Boot and a Golang web framework. The temporary php backend will be replaced once implemented.
